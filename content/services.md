## Geoscience

{{< figure src="/img/geoscience.png" width="80%" class="img-centered" >}}


I am available to assist clients with all stages of their exploration and appraisal workflows either stand-alone
or embedded within the clients existing teams providing geological/geophysical data analysis, report/regulator
submission preparations and JV/management presentations.

I can bring to your projects 38+ years of experience in petroleum exploration and development spanning Australia,
Asia, New Zealand, Africa and the Middle East and a diverse skill set covering seismic acquisition, processing
and interpretation, regional play assessment, prospect and lead generation and new ventures evaluation.

Having directly contributed to hydrocarbon discoveries in Australia, Indonesia, Yemen, Tunisia and
Papua New Guinea and possessing substantial experience across both subtle (low relief closures and stratigraphic
plays) and complex (wrench, thrust and salt tectonics) plays, I can positively enhance your exploration outcomes.

## Software

{{< figure src="/img/software.jpg" width="80%" class="img-centered" >}}


I am the leading contributor of open source plugins to the [OpendTect](https://dgbes.com/software/plugins/free-third-party-plugins)
seismic interpretation and visualization platform. These
[10+ plugins](https://waynegm.github.io/WMPlugin-Docs/) extend OpendTect with attributes for AVO analysis,
structure oriented filtering, spectral decomposition and a Python programming interface. Other plugins,
2D-3D horizon gridding, mistie analysis and correction and GIS data export, enhance OpendTect for general
seismic interpretation workflows.

I can develop proprietary plugins for clients wishing to extend OpendTect.

With substantial experience using most of the major exploration software packages, I can advise clients on
best practices for data management or migration and, where necessary, implement bespoke software solutions
to efficiently drive data management/migration workflows.

I can advise on the use of open source software in exploration whether it is GIS, seismic interpretation or
seismic processing.

I offer bespoke technical software development in the C, C++, Python or Javascript languages on both Linux
and Windows.
