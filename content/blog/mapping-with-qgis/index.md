## Well Symbols
- [Blackbeard Data Services](https://blackbearddata.com/symbols) provide a set of SVG format well symbols and instructions 
for loading them into QGIS but the instructions are for QGIS pre v3.0. Installation is pretty simple:
    -  Use the "Settings|Options" menu item to open the Option dialog. 
    -  Select the "System" tab.
    -  Add the path of the well symbol file to the "SVG Paths" box.
